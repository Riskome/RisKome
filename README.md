## Hey there 👋🏾 Welcome to my GitHub!

### 👨🏾‍💻 I'm 0xZeusDev – a Rust SDK, Agentic AI and Data platform Engineer building autonomous systems for gaming a

As a **Rust-based SDK and agentic AI engineer**, I specialize in building high-performance, low-latency tools for emotionally intelligent, goal-driven agents in dynamic environments. I also specialize in recognizing, choosing, and creating effective data systems and pipelines. These systems enable smooth and secure data flow throughout all processes, empowering data-driven decision-making.

My current focus is on open-source decentralized SDKs that enable developers to integrate LLMs and emotional modeling into non-playable characters (NPCs), allowing them to adapt, evolve, and create emergent narratives in games.

These agents aren't just reactive — they feel, remember, and grow. And I'm excited to be helping build the infrastructure that lets them do that, while staying committed to the values of open access and decentralized innovation.

### 🧠 What I Do:
- Build **autonomous, emotional NPCs** using multi-LLM orchestration and memory systems
- Develop and maintain **modular Rust-based SDKs**
- Integrate AI pipelines with **Unity, WebAssembly**, and soon Unreal Engine
- Collaborate on decentralized systems that **don’t compromise performance or vision**
- Contribute to projects with **zero dox requirement** — letting the tech speak louder than the devs.
- leverage cloud technologies such as GCP and AWS, alongside DevOps best practices, for all my data projects.
