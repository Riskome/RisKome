 AI Credit Risk Assessment

This project aims to build an AI-powered model for assessing credit risk and predicting borrower default risk. The model leverages both traditional financial data (such as credit score and loan amount) and alternative data (such as debt-to-income ratio, age, and other factors) to predict whether a borrower is likely to default on their loan. The goal is to help financial institutions make more informed decisions and reduce risks associated with lending.

Key features of the project include:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Model Building:** Using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and advanced techniques (e.g., XGBoost) for prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision.
- **Deployment:** Plans for integrating the model into a real-time API service for use in financial applications.

This repository will include:
- The code for the machine learning model.
- Example datasets.
- Detailed documentation on how to run and evaluate the model.
- Insights and next steps for improving model accuracy and generalizability.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub Actions.
