### **RiskOme: Command-Line Credit Risk Assessment Tool**

**RiskOme** is a simple AI agent that simulates credit risk assessment using a command-line interface (CLI). This version provides random predictions for **"Low Risk"** or **"High Risk"**, designed for demonstration and testing purposes. Future versions will integrate real data and machine learning models.

---

### **Features**
- Command-line interface for user interaction  
- Simulates risk prediction based on age, income, and loan amount  
- Lightweight and easy to modify for different use cases  

---

### **How It Works**
1. The script takes simulated input for **age**, **monthly income**, and **loan amount**.  
2. It predicts the credit risk level as **"Low Risk"** or **"High Risk"** using a random prediction model.  
3. Results are displayed on the command line for immediate feedback.

### **Installation & Usage**
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/riskome.git
   cd riskome
   ```

2. **Run the script**:  
   If you have Python installed, execute the script with:  
   ```bash
   python riskome_cli.py
   ```

3. **Modify the inputs**:  
   You can customize the input values in the `run_cli()` function to test different scenarios.

### **Future Plans**
- Integrate a real credit risk prediction model  
- Build a web-based interface using **Streamlit**  
- Add support for real-time user input and data visualization
