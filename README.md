- **Telegram Bot Integration** for real-time interaction and predictions  
- **Custom Model Training** using uploaded CSV files  
- Predict whether a user is a **High Risk** or **Low Risk**  
- Supports machine learning model training and predictions from user data

## Telegram Bot Instructions  
### Step 1: Start the Bot  
1. Open Telegram and search for the bot using the handle provided.  
2. Click **Start** to begin. The bot will respond with a welcome message.  

### Step 2: Upload a CSV File

   | 45  | 60000  | 25000       | 1       |  

2. The bot will automatically train the model on the uploaded data.  

### Step 3: Make Predictions  
- Type any text message to predict the risk based on the previously trained model.  
- The bot will respond with **High Risk** or **Low Risk**.
